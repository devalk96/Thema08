# Introduction
Introduction of the research and introduction research questions

## Goal
  - Describe Goal (not the educational goal but the research goal)
  - Describe how you reach the goal (e.g. make model and figures, use different setting)
  - formulate hypothesis

## Theory

- Describe biological model
- Picture of the biological model

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='95%'}
#knitr::include_graphics('example.png')
```
Give an explanation of the model with citations of source \cite{Soertaert10} (replace this with actual source)
and formula explanation

$$\frac{\delta R}{\delta t} = -r * R + m $$
Describe each element and the transformations

# Methods

## The software model

- Describe the software tools used, as well as the libraries
- Describe the software implementation (note: code below is an example)
```{r}
library(deSolve)

parameters <- c(ks_rm = 2.90,
                IC50_rm = 26.2,
                kon = 0.00329,
                kt = 0.63,
                kre = 0.57,
                Rf = 0.49,
                kd_r = 0.0572,
                kd_rm = 0.612,
                ks_r = 3.22,
                D = 20*1000/374.471)

state <- c(MRNAr = 4.74,
           R = 267,
           DR = 0,
           DRn = 0)

Gluco <- function(t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)),{
    # rate of change
    dMRNAr <- ks_rm * (1 - DRn/(IC50_rm + DRn)) - kd_rm * MRNAr
    dR <- ks_r * MRNAr + Rf * kre * DRn - kon * D * R - kd_r * R
    dDR <- kon * D * R - kt * DR
    dDRn <- kt * DR - kre * DRn
    
    # return the rate of change
    list(c(dMRNAr, dR, dDR, dDRn))
  }) # end with(as.list ...
}

times <- seq(0, 48, by = 0.01)


out <- ode(y = state, times = times, func = Gluco, parms = parameters)
head(out)


plot(out, xlab = "Time (h)", 
     ylab = c("(fmol/g liver)", "(fmol/mg protein)", "(fmol/mg protein)", "(fmol/mg protein)"), 
     main = c("Receptor mRNA", "Free receptor consetration", "Drug-receptor complex", "Activated receptor complex"),
     col="purple")
```

## Model configuration

Explain chosen initial state, parameter values and time sequence. Use tables with values as for example below
\begin{longtable}[l]{l|l|l}
\caption{Parameter Values} \\ \hline
\label{param_table}
$\textbf{Parameter}$             &$\textbf{Value}$& $\textbf{Unit}$              \\ \hline
\endhead
$a$       & 0.08  & $hour^{-1}$         \\ \hline
$b$       & 0.06  & $hour^{-1}$         \\ \hline
$c$       & 0.06  & $hour^{-1}$         \\ \hline
\end{longtable}


# Results
Introduction of results, how does it answer your research questions.
```{r}
#plot(out)
#code to generate figures with title, subscripts, legenda etc
```

- Describe what can be seen in such way that it leads to an answer to your research questions
- Give your figures a number and a descriptive title.
- Provide correct axis labels (unit and quantity), legend and caption.
- Always refer to and discuss your figures and tables in the text - they never stand alone.


# Discussion and Conclusion
## Discussion
- Compare your results with what is expecting from the literature and discuss differences with them.
- Discuss striking and surprising results.
- Discuss weaknesses in your research and how they could be addressed.

## General conclusion and perspective
Discuss what your goal was, what the end result is and how you could continue working from here.
